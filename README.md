Thank you for checking out my app!

Least Busy orangizes a list of your favorite restaurants from least busy to most busy. You can quickly see how busy restaurants are at the current time or when you get there from any address. You can add your favorite restaurants to your profile and the dashboard will sort the restaurant based on busyness. Addresses can also be saved for the "When I get there" feature.

Currently the app is a proof of concept. The busyness infomation is made up using a script I wrote when restuarants are added to a user's profile. In the production version of the app I will use historical Facebook check-in information to predict how busy restuarants are at a particular time.
